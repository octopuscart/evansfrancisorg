                                        An evangelist, author, teacher and lyricist with uncompromising faithfulness to the Holy Scriptures, Evans brings clarity to the message needed for the Body of Christ to uncover the unseen riches in God's word.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Born in a village called Mukerian, Punjab, India, in 1988, Evans began his evangelistic career at a very tender age of nineteen. Despite many hurdles, challenges, and obstacles, Evans did not deviate from his work but continued to follow the path God gave him through vision and calling.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        On 18th July 2017, Evans got married to Neha, who was born and brought up in Bhilai, Chattisgarh, and together they are fulfilling the call they have upon their lives travelling around the globe.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Evans has established churches, teach and preach the Word of God and is busy bringing many to the Kingdom of God. Evans has written and composed a number of biblical books and songs. Evans shares the Word of God through his YouTube channel name "Evans Francis", and millions have viewed his videos till date. Without any fear, he shares the dreams, visions and messages that God gives him for the body of Christ.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Evans uncompromisingly stresses on correct interpretation, understanding and application of the Word of God as it should be by each individual being a New Testament believer.
